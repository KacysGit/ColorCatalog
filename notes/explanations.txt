Here I'll write notable portions of the course

__FlexBox__

Gives ability to compose styles anywhere on a screen

Flex Containers: either display child elements in a row or in a column
    default is in a column
Flex Elements: the objects in a container 

justifyContent: "space-between", // spaces the elements evenly within a container
justifyContent: "space-around", // spaces the elements from the margins of the container
